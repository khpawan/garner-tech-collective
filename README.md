# Garner Tech Collective — Manifesto v0.1
> *"Build local. Learn together. Share freely."*

## 🌍 Why We Exist

Garner is full of incredible technologists — engineers, PMs, data scientists, designers, and security folks — quietly building the future from home offices and coffee shops.  

But we rarely cross paths. We're connected to teams across the world, yet disconnected from the people building just down the street.

It's time to fix that.

The **Garner Tech Collective** is a local experiment in community — a space for people who want to **learn, build, and grow together right here**.

No corporate slides.  
No recruiters.  
No sales pitches.  

Just real humans sharing what they're learning in AI, cloud, data, and security — and maybe giving back a little while we're at it.

## ⚙️ What We Do

- **Monthly Meetups**  
  Lightning talks, demos, and hands-on workshops — practical, not theoretical.

- **Community Outreach**  
  Free tech education sessions at local libraries and schools to help the public use technology safely and confidently.

- **Social Nights**  
  Chill evenings at a café or brewery — no agenda, just conversations and connections.

- **Open Projects**  
  Small, local ideas that actually help people — civic tech, open data, or even kids' STEM days.

## 💡 Our Principles

1. **Open and Welcoming** — Everyone's invited. Leave ego at the door.  
2. **No Sales, No Recruiting** — We're here to learn and collaborate, not pitch.  
3. **Show, Don't Tell** — We demo, we share code, we experiment.  
4. **Community First** — Respect, inclusion, and curiosity are non-negotiable.  
5. **Local Impact** — What we build here should make Garner a little smarter, safer, or more inspired.

## 📚 Education in the Age of AI

AI is changing how we learn, teach, and think. The old model — memorize, test, repeat — is fading.  
The new world belongs to people who can **ask better questions, think critically, and apply judgment** in partnership with intelligent systems.

At the Garner Tech Collective, we believe that:
- Education is shifting from *knowing answers* to *framing problems well.*  
- AI should **amplify curiosity**, not replace it.  
- Every student, parent, and professional deserves access to tools — and understanding — to use AI responsibly.  
- Learning must become a **community act** again, not a solitary grind.

Our outreach programs, workshops, and talks are built on this belief:  
> **Teach people to think, not just to prompt.**
